         	Our page features easy to navigate sections with pleasing rounded edges and colors that are easy on the eyes. The days are separated by individual sections and each section is separated by adequate spaced for the reading, homework, grades, and the lab. The space for the readings expands depending on the amount of readings for that day. There is no scrolling within the block for the homework because of this expansion feature, and it is all laid out without having to click a separate link. 
	<br> 
		 The completed tasks have a light grey background where current tasks have a light blue background for visual ques as to what has been done already and what is current. The top menu follows the theme of rounded edges and carries over the yellow color from the sections below. It also has hover options. 
	<br>
		 We achieved this look by first separating each element in the CSS and then modifying them from there. We also created a mock template in order to plan out our color scheme before applying it to the website.
